Visitors will find that the car park is free and offers ample space for vans.
Additionally, there are various amenities, including a supermarket, Costa, and
KFC, all within a five-minute drive.

There are also beautiful walks in the area, although visitors should be cautious
as there are sometimes horses around. Generally, it is safe to let dogs off the
lead, but obviously double check.

The monument honours Aneurin Bevan, a politician born in Tredegar in 1897 who
was one of the visionaries behind the National Health Service.
